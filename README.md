# COVIDRedBlueStates
This was a bit of a research I did using RStudio. I used 20 US states to look at how the laws in each state (Republican and Democrats) affected the number of COVID-19 cases. 
In the repository, I have a .rmd file and an html link to look at the study. This was a group project and everyone contributed equally.
